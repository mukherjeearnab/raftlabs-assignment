# RaftLabs - Assignment 2

## Project Definition

-   Write a program that takes the position of a Knight as an input on an 8x8 chessboard.
-   Given the position of the Knight, find all the possible places where the Knight can
    move. You can assume that there are no pieces of the opposite color and hence no
    blocks.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

To test the app, first install the dependencies using:

    npm install

Once the dependencies have been installed, run:

    npm start

to start the CLI application.

### Instructions

Enter the starting position of the Knight in the format `row, column`. Once the position is entered, the program will compute and display all the positions that can be visited by the knight.

`O` means the starting position of the knight, as entered by the user. `X` means the positions the knight can visit starting from position `O`.
